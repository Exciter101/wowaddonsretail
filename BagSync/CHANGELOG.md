-   
    - Small little fix to display a guild on another realm (Connected Realms) if the currently logged player is a member of it.  This will only work if the "Guilds" option is enabled in BagSync and if the guild is on another realm other then the one the player is currently playing on.  In addition this new option will only work "XR" and "BNET" options are disabled in BagSync.  (Connected Servers and BNET)  
    - A fix to cleanout old guild data if a player leaves a guild.
