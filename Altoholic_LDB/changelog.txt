Altoholic LDB::Changelog

r4 | 28-11-2008 | Slashee the Cow
Changed the way the feed loads so as to avoid many possible problems and use less memory (not that the latter was a problem, but always nice).
In case you're just joining us, there was an r3 but it bombed severly and is now considered th be heresy.

r2.1.1 | 14-11-2008 | Slashee the Cow
Changed name of LDB feed so it will show up separately to Altoholic's built in feed.

r2.1 | 12-11-2008 | Slashee the Cow
Still didn't have files in correct order. D'oh!
Addon name changed in TOC (will no longer show up with underscores in addon list).

r2 | 12-11-2008 | Slashee the Cow
Right click on button now opens Altoholic options (updated tooltip to reflect this).
Removed "LDB" from the end of the feed name (some people might be using labels).
Files now loaded in correct order (my bad, sorry).
Mod is now loaded by using an invisible frame (simpler and should cause less problems).

r1 | 11-11-2008 | Slashee the Cow
This is the first release (not that I see a long series of updates in this mod's future).
