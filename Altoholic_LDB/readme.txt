Altoholic LDB

First I'd like to note that I'm well aware Altholic now includes its own LDB feed, however I find it somewhat lacking.

All it does is add a LibDataBroker feed to open Altoholic. There's no config for this, although you'll have to remove the minimap button for Altoholic manually (assuming you want to, although it IS the reason I created this mod.)

Simple, two button operation: Left click opens Altoholic normally, and right click opens Altoholic options.

There aren't any slash commands (I said earlier, no config). If you want to enable or disable this I guess you have two options... log out and use the addon manager on the character select screen, or just don't get whatever you use to display your LDB feeds to display this one.

Thanks to:
	Thaoky (author of Altoholic), without you this would be kind of pointless.
	Tekkub (author of various mods), you have great documentation on LDB.
