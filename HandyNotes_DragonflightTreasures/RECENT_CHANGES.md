## Changed in v27

* Changed the group-hiding behavior: hiding a group from the top-level menu will now apply to all zones, and if you want to hide one in only a specific zone you'll have to go into the "zones" submenu
* Add the War Supply Chests, hidden by default because they're only relevant if you're in war mode
* Add the Best Spell Ever quest for Mages in Azure Span, for Polymorph: Duck
* Profession Knowledge: Flashfrozen Scroll questid, thanks to tfmonk
* Honor Our Ancestors: show that Muqur will accept *any* quality of boot enchant, thanks to Mr-nUUb
* Add assorted rares and loot, mostly in Ohn'ahran Plains
