## Changed in v31

* Starting on adding Disturbed Dirt locations; like the Explorer's Scout Packs these are hidden by default, so turn them on in the menu if you want to see them
* Waking Shores: fix Slurpo's position, explain the spawn requirements, and show the required item in Azure Span
* Explain Ingot's position for A Dragon's Day Off if you need it
* Highest Peaks: fix the renown level requirement, it only needs 6 now
* Assorted rare quests and loot
