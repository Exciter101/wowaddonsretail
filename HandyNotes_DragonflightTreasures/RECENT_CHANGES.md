## Changed in v29

* Give the known ["super rares"](https://www.wowhead.com/news/defeat-super-rares-each-day-for-up-to-385-item-level-gear-330298) a distinctive icon and a note explaining the concept
* Some improvements to the grand hunt bosses
* Show Khadin on the map after doing his quests, since you can return to trade shards for knowledge
* Add the generic-daily for Lizi's Reins so we can hide the point after you're done for the day
